## Introduction
In this module, we will explore the foundational aspects of machine learning that will help you understand more complex algorithms and models in the field. 

## Perceptron
The Perceptron is one of the earliest types of artificial neural networks, developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. It is used for binary classification tasks. Here are the key points:
- **Architecture**: A Perceptron consists of input values, weights, a bias, and an activation function.
- **Working**: It calculates a weighted sum of the inputs and applies a step function to predict the output.
- **Training**: The Perceptron is trained using a supervised learning approach. We adjust the weights based on the error in predictions using the Perceptron learning rule.

## Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models. Key aspects include:
- **Concept**: Gradient Descent iteratively adjusts parameters of the model by calculating the gradient of the cost function to find the minimum point.
- **Types**: There are several variants of Gradient Descent including Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, each with its own use cases.
- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter that affects the speed and quality of convergence.

## Conclusion
Understanding the Perceptron and Gradient Descent is essential for anyone delving into machine learning. This module provides you with the necessary tools and concepts to further explore advanced topics in this domain.
